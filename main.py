"""
Simple interactive ChatGPT CLI example using the `openai` Python library.

Usage:
1. Put your API key in `config.py` as:
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your key..."
2. Run: `python chatgpt_cli.py`

This script reads the key from `.config.txt`, keeps a short conversation
history, and sends messages to the Chat Completions API.

    # Example:
    # TOOL_CALL: {"tool":"getCurrentDateAndTime","args":{"fmt":"%c"}}
    # The client will run the tool and then send the tool output back as a
    # message with role `tool` so the assistant can continue.
